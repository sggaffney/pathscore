        The total number of variants used in the analysis, after filtering.
        These correspond to rows in the upload file that have valid hugo-entrez

    </dd>

    <dt>Unused</dt>
    <dd>
        'Unused' variants are those with valid hugo-entrez pairs, but the

    <dd>
        'Rejected' variants are those with <em>invalid</em> hugo-entrez pairs.
