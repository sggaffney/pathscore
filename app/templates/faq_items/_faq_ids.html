    All variants must be listed with both Hugo Symbol (aka HGNC symbol) and
    Entrez ID for each gene. Entrez ID refers to the 'Gene ID' from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene">NCBI Gene</a> database.

    You might want to try my automated symbol matching script on GitHub, which
    will attempt to determine up to date identifiers from symbol and chromosome:
    <a href="http://github.com/sggaffney/gene_matcher">http://github.com/sggaffney/gene_matcher</a>.

    For a table containing identifiers for all human genes, refer to
    their flat file
    <a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz">
        Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz</a>. This file contains Hugo Symbol and
    Entrez ID in the 'Symbol' and 'GeneId' columns, respectively. Synonyms and
    external database identifiers are also listed.

    If your variants are listed with Ensembl transcripts, the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/">Ensembl Biomart</a>
    can be used to obtain a map from Ensembl transcript ID to Hugo Symbol and
    Entrez ID.
